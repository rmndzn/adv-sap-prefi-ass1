## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-  Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages. Developers use SOA to reuse services in different systems or combine several independent services to perform complex tasks.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Scalability, Ease of Maintenance and Diversity are the benefits of using Microservices.

Scability means in Microservices that the service that you give to the user is easy to handle without error or crash.

Ease of Maintenance means that Microservices can maintain itself by updating regularly.

Diversity means that microservices can be use in different technology that people are suitable to it.

3. Define Microservices.
- The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably - a necessity for competing and winning in todayâ€™s world.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

Ease of Maintenance means that Microservices can maintain itself by updating regularly.

Diversity means that microservices can be use in different technology that people are suitable to it.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- Similarities
Both SOA and Microservices have scalability, Flexibility, and Scalability.

- Differences
Autonomy is the differences of SOA and Microservices because Microservices are used to be highly autonomous while SOA is less.
